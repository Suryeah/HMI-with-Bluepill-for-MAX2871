# HMI-with-Bluepill-for-MAX2871

	This project is for interfacing HMI with STM32F103 [Bluepill] through UART using RS232. Bluepill communicates with MAX2871 using SPI protocol. Thus proving an over all solution to generate RF output with HMI Interface. 

I used Proface HMI 4100 Series and have attached the screens for the same, Use GP-Pro Ex 4.09 to open the file. There are other screens in the file as this project is gonna be updated for more features in upcomming commits.

Use the Frame Format text file for knowing communication sequence between controller and HMI.
